### **DevOps Final Project: Deploying a Scalable Application**

In this project, you will leverage best practices in DevOps to deploy an application using modern tools and methodologies. Follow the steps below to build, containerize, and deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring high standards of automation and reliability.

---

### **Project Objectives**

1. **Version Control**  
   - Create a GitHub repository or fork one of the following repositories:
     - [NodeJS-Docker-Project](https://github.com/sherifkunch/NodeJS-Docker-Project-2025-jan19-devops)
     - [Final-Project](https://github.com/sherifkunch/final-project-jan2025)

2. **Containerization and Registry**  
   - Containerize the application using Docker.
   - Use **Terraform** to create an **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** with a private registry for storing Docker images.
   - Push the built Docker images to the ECR.

3. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**  
   - Create a Kubernetes cluster using **eksctl**.
   - Write the necessary Kubernetes manifests:
     - `deployment.yaml`: Define the application pods.
     - `service.yaml`: Expose the application using a **LoadBalancer** service type.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the CI/CD process:
     - Trigger the pipeline when a pull request is opened to the `main` branch.
     - Dynamically tag Docker images using the GitHub commit SHA.

5. **Application Deployment**  
   - Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Verify that the application is accessible via the LoadBalancer endpoint:  
     `http://<IP>:<port>`

6.  **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - Create detailed documentation in your GitHub repository, including:
     - Setup instructions.
     - Pipeline workflow diagram.
     - Explanation of key DevOps practices followed.
   - Generate deployment and vulnerability scan reports as part of your

### **Bonus Objectives**  
Go beyond the basics to demonstrate advanced skills and ensure your solution is production-ready:

1. **Advanced Infrastructure Automation**  
   - Use **Terraform** instead of `eksctl` to create the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Helm Integration**  
   - Create a `helm` folder and write a Helm chart to manage your application deployment.

3. **Security Scans**  
   - Integrate **Trivy** into your pipeline to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.  
   - Allow image pushes only if no **critical vulnerabilities** are detected.

4. **Testing Automation**  
   - Add **smoke tests** to validate application health after deployment.

5. **Multi-Cluster Deployment**  
   - Manually deploy the application to a separate cluster (e.g., a production cluster) to test multi-environment compatibility.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. **GitHub Repository**  
   - A public/private repository containing your application code, CI/CD pipeline, Terraform code, Kubernetes manifests, and/or Helm charts.

2. **Deployed Application**  
   - A functional application accessible via the provided LoadBalancer endpoint.

3. **Documentation**  
   - Clear and concise documentation of your approach, including challenges and solutions.

4. **Bonus Features** *(Optional)*  
   - Submit a separate report or folder showcasing the bonus objectives you completed.
